#### What you need:
* Snakes and Ladders board
* Dice
* Playing pieces

#### Instructions:
* Follow normal snakes and ladders rules.
* Each block you land on should have a number associated with it, and for that 
number there is a corresponding function below.
* The starting value for everyone is 50.
* After landing on each block, pass in your current value to the corresponding function 
and write down the function number and your result, use the result for your next function. 
(Note: Do the calculation on your own, no coding should be involved yet. 
You can however use Google)
* When you have reached the 100th block, go back and run your value through each 
function by coding it, and compare the result you wrote down with the value the 
code produced.
* For each result you got right, you get a point.
* Person who gets to the 100th block first with the most correct answers wins.

*Take note:*
* When the result is undefined, indicate that it is undefined and use the result
from the previous function for your next function.
* All players need to reach the 100th block.
